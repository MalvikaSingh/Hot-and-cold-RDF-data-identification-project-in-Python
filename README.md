# Hot-and-cold-RDF-data-identification-project-in-Python
Efficiently and non-intrusively identify the K hottest records, i.e., most frequently accessed, among a large set of records. The access frequency (heat) of each record is estimated from a sequence of record access observations. Efficient caching mechanism for dynamic identification of hot and cold data.
