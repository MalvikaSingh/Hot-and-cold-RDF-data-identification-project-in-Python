# Hot-and-cold-RDF-data-identification-project-in-Python
Efficiently and non-intrusively identify the K hottest records, i.e., most frequently accessed, among a large set of records. The access frequency (heat) of each record is estimated from a sequence of record access observations. Efficient caching mechanism for dynamic identification of hot and cold data. Used Python, an object oriented programming language for this purpose.
Accomplished as a part of undergraduate research under Professor Minal Bhise at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.
